# COP-2839-Week-1-Creating-Your-First-ASP.NET-Core-MVC-Application
Beginner application of ASP.NET Core MVC
This app allows users to store a list of products by entering the name of the item and the price of the item. The application can edit, delete, and see the details of the products in the list. It allows for searching for specific items in the search bar.

In order to run the app, download the zip folder and extract all the files. You can open up Visual Studio or double click the folder to access the files. If you are opening with Visual Studio 2022, click on Visual Studio and click the 'Open a project or solution'. Go the where the folder is stored then double-click it, double-click it again to see the actual files. Scroll down until you see the solution file(ends with .sln). Select the solution file and then open it. Press the green play button that says https to run and open up a website or press F5. If a textbox that pops-up asking you to trust a certificate, click yes both times. If you are accessing it via directly double clicking the extracted folder, double click on the folder again to access the real files. Scroll down the the solution file and double click it to open up the project.

When you open up the website, the url will be a localhost:<port#>(The port number is random). Click on the Product app header/link which will lead you to the Index webpage where the list of items and the price can be stored, the header is located on the top left corner of the page. In order to add products to the list click on 'Create new' and type the item name and price. Finally click on the 'Save' button to store the product on to the list. You can click on the 'Home' link or the header to navigate to the home page. You can use the search bar to search for the product you are looking to find. If you are done with the app, close the window by click on the x-button on the top right corner of the window. Make sure to also close the console command after closing the app afterwards.

How the MVC app was made:
First, the model was created first in order to get and set the item name and price in the Model folder. Second, went to the Controllers folder and added a Scaffolded Item named it ProductController that uses views with an Entity Framework. It allowed for an Index action to return a strongly typed model and view. The database provider was a SQL Server. Third, I added a Migration Initial Create then updated the database. Fourth, I added a tag helper for navigation and form post for the search bar. Finally I used ILogger in the ProductController to send information to the command console.

There are dependencies that was used to create the app. The model called Product to bind and display the data structure, MvcProductsContext for the database, and ILogger to send logs to the console command. 

I had to search for a while to understand what tag helpers were and ILogger and watch a few videos about them. I found out there were different levels to ILogger to send to the console.
